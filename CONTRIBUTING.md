# Contribution Guidelines

The easiest way to get started with questions, bugfixes or feature requests is to open an issue, or a pull request.

## Issues, Commits, Commit Messages, and PRs

Ideally, an issue would be created before doing any major work on a new feature/bugfix. This serves the purpose of getting
a discussion going as early as possible and allows for tracking related changes by including the issue number in the commit
messages.

Short and descriptive commit messages are preferred over detailed explanations of the changes; if more context is needed,
that information should be in the pull request.
